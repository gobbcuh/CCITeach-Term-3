            <p class="caption">The first photo was from the very first GDG on Campus NU Manila event I joined. It was online, and I still remember feeling a bit overwhelmed but super amazed by the speaker. It was also the first event I attended as a freshman, so I felt kind of proud of myself for actually joining and participating—even if it was just virtual.</p>

            <p class="caption">The second photo was from my first face-to-face GDGOC NU event. I remember arriving an hour early but still hesitating to enter the room. I almost backed out, but I'm so glad I pushed through. Everyone there—from the officers to the members—was really kind and welcoming. It ended up being one of the best choices I made because I finally got to connect and interact with people in person. It made the whole experience a lot more fun and memorable.</p>
